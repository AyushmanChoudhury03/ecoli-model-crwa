# ecoli-model-crwa

This repository contains work that I did during my virtual Winternship at the Charles River Watershed Association in January 2023. CRWA has a series of flags at 4 locations along the Charles River in Massachusetts that alert recreational users, like boaters and swimmers, of the predicted population of E. coli in the water. For my internship, I revamped this model using R.

In this project, I gathered and cleansed data from CRWA's internal databases and USGS sensors, wrangled it in R to create data frames of various predictors of E. coli, and constructed Generative Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) models to predict the E. coli populations. I documented my process and created a report using RMarkdown. 

Thank you to Lisa Kumpf and Max Rome at CRWA for the opportunity to work on these models, and for their support during my Winternship!
