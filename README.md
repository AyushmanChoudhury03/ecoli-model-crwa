# ecoli-model-crwa

This repository contains work that I did during my virtual Winternship at the Charles River Watershed Association in January 2023. CRWA has a series of flags at 4 locations along the Charles River in Massachusetts that alert recreational users, like boaters and swimmers, of the predicted population of E. coli in the water. For my internship, I revamped this model using R.

In this project, I gathered and cleansed data from CRWA's internal databases and USGS sensors, wrangled it in R to create data frames of various features like weather and river discharge data, and constructed Generative Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) models to predict the E. coli populations from these features. I documented my process and created a report using RMarkdown. 

This report is best viewed as an HTML Document (it may need to be downloaded and opened locally), but I have also uploaded a PDF printout into this repository.

Thank you to Lisa Kumpf and Max Rome at CRWA for the opportunity to work on these models, and for their support during my Winternship!
